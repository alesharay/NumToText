# Convert a Numbert to Text

This application takes in a numeric value and converts it into it's textual equivalent.
<br>
The program does no error checking as it was just a quick challenge given to me.

## How to Run

To run the app, change into the root directory of the repository where the makefile is located. 
<br>
From there, run the command "make app". This command will like all libraries, compile, and run the application all in one step.
<br> 
To clean the useless files when you are done running the app, run the command "make clean" from the root directory.

## How to Use

The application will require you to put in a number. As there is no error checking, if an unrecognizable value is entered, the program will default to zero.
<br>
If a valid number is entered, the program will inform you of the numeric value you've entered along with it's textual equivalent.
